Hello, if you came this far it is because you are as obsessed as I am, and you are looking for a way to obtain an achievement in the Purple Place game on Steam. The achievement is "Very Sharp Eye".

THE CODE IS MADE TO WORK ON 1920 X 1080 SCREENS (I don't know how it will react with smaller screens)

Requirements:
1. Have Visual Studio Code installed, with the extensions: "Python" and "Jupiter".
2. You must have the following modules installed: "Mouse", "Time" and "Keyboard".

I created this code that simulates the following sequence within the game automatically:
1. Enter the clothing minigame.
2. Choose clothes.
3. Check if it is correct.
4. Return to the main menu.
5. Repeat.
This sequence is defaulted to repeat 3125 times (you can increase the value if you want) and starts 4 seconds after you execute it, but you can stop it by holding down the letter "q" for 7 seconds.

Instructions:
1. Open the code with Visual Studio Code and minimize its size.
2. Open the game "Purple Place" on Steam and leave it in the minigame selection (you can see the 3 minigames (The Cakes, Pairs and Clothes minigame)).
3. Using Alt + Tab select Visual Studio Code.
4. Run the code in an interactive window and quickly minimize Visual Studio Code.
5. See the magic.
6. If you want to stop the code, press and hold the letter "q" for 7 seconds.

WARNING: I don't know how the code will react if it's not run in Visual Studio Code, so good luck.
