THE CODE IS MADE TO WORK ON 1920 X 1080 SCREENS (I don't know how it will react with smaller screens)

Requirements:
1. Have Visual Studio Code installed, with the extensions: "Python" and "Jupiter".
2. You must have the following modules installed: "Mouse", "Time" and "Keyboard".

Instructions:
1. Open the code with Visual Studio Code and minimize its size.
2. Open the game "Purple Place" on Steam and leave it in the minigame selection (you can see the 3 minigames (The Cakes, Pairs and Clothes minigame)).
3. Using Alt + Tab select Visual Studio Code.
4. Run the code in an interactive window and quickly minimize Visual Studio Code.
5. See the magic.
6. If you want to stop the code, press and hold the letter "q" for 7 seconds.

WARNING: I don't know how the code will react if it's not run in Visual Studio Code, so good luck.
:p
